# Radio-Garden
Listen to thousands of live radio stations by rotating the globe.

Radio Garden works like any other digital radio but, in this case, the world is your tuning dial. As you turn it with your mouse, gliding between borders, over cities and towns, it crackles and tunes into every station available in the area.

The project was designed by Amsterdamâ€™s Studio Puckey. It lets users listen to 7,877 radio stations around the world by dragging and dropping a pointer over a 3D Google Earth interface.
